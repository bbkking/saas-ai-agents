# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of specialized Claude Code agents designed for **SaaS (Software as a Service) development**. These are expert-level AI agents that cover the complete SaaS development lifecycle, from initial planning through scaled production deployment.

**Purpose**: Accelerate SaaS development by providing expert guidance across all disciplines needed to build successful SaaS applications.

## Agent Template Format

Each agent template is a JSON file with the following structure:
- `name`: Agent identifier
- `description`: Use case and specialization
- `color`: Visual identifier
- `model`: Claude model to use
- `instructions`: Detailed behavioral instructions and expertise

## SaaS Development Focus

This agent collection is specifically designed for **SaaS application development** with the following considerations:

### SaaS-Specific Features
- **Multi-tenant architecture** patterns and implementations
- **Subscription billing** integration and management
- **Scalability planning** for rapid user growth
- **Security compliance** (SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA considerations)
- **Performance optimization** for concurrent users
- **API-first architecture** for integrations and mobile apps

### Technology Stack Coverage
Our agents support multiple technology stacks commonly used in SaaS:

#### Backend Technologies
- **Node.js** (Express, Fastify, NestJS) with PostgreSQL/MySQL
- **ASP.NET Core** with SQL Server/PostgreSQL  
- **Python** (Django, FastAPI) with PostgreSQL/MongoDB
- **Java** (Spring Boot) with PostgreSQL/MySQL

#### Frontend Technologies
- **React** with TypeScript (Redux, Context API, React Query)
- **Angular** with TypeScript (NgRx, RxJS)
- **Vue.js** (future support planned)

#### Cloud Platforms
- **AWS** (comprehensive examples and patterns)
- **Microsoft Azure** (enterprise-focused deployments)
- **Google Cloud Platform** (data-intensive applications)

## Working with SaaS Agent Templates

### Analyzing Agent Templates
When examining these files, focus on:
- **SaaS-specific challenges** addressed by each agent
- **Multi-technology examples** showing different implementation approaches
- **Scalability patterns** designed for growth
- **Security best practices** for SaaS applications
- **Integration patterns** with other agents in the collection

### Modifying Agent Templates  
When editing agent templates for SaaS projects:
1. **Preserve SaaS Focus**: Maintain emphasis on multi-tenancy, scalability, security
2. **Multi-Stack Support**: Include examples for different technology combinations
3. **Real-World Patterns**: Use patterns proven in production SaaS applications
4. **Integration Awareness**: Consider how agents work together in SaaS development
5. **Business Metrics**: Include relevant SaaS business considerations

### Creating New SaaS Agent Templates
Follow the established SaaS-focused pattern:
1. **Define SaaS Role**: Clear boundaries within SaaS development lifecycle
2. **SaaS Philosophy**: Include principles specific to SaaS challenges
3. **Multi-Technology Support**: Provide examples across major tech stacks
4. **Scalability Focus**: Address growth and scaling considerations
5. **Security Emphasis**: Include security patterns for SaaS applications
6. **Business Alignment**: Connect technical decisions to business outcomes

## SaaS Agent Specializations

### Core Development Agents (Essential for Every SaaS)
- **Backend Engineer**: Multi-tenant APIs, database design, authentication, subscription logic, performance optimization
- **Frontend Engineer**: React/Angular components, responsive design, real-time updates, accessibility, progressive web apps
- **System Architect**: Technology stack selection, multi-tenant architecture, scalability planning, integration design
- **DevOps Engineer**: CI/CD automation, cloud infrastructure, auto-scaling, monitoring, security configuration

### Quality & Security Agents (Critical for Production SaaS)
- **QA Testing Engineer**: Automated testing, load testing, multi-tenant test isolation, continuous quality assurance

## Getting Started with SaaS Development

1. **Read the Documentation**: Start with [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting-started.md)
2. **Understand the Lifecycle**: Review [Agent Overview](docs/agent-overview.md) 
3. **Choose Your Starting Point**: 
   - New SaaS project → Start with **Product Manager** and **System Architect**
   - Existing project → Use **System Architect** for technical audit
   - Scaling project → Focus on **DevOps Engineer** and **Backend Engineer**
4. **Build Your SaaS**: Use agents collaboratively throughout development

This collection transforms SaaS development from a complex multi-disciplinary challenge into a guided, expert-supported process. Each agent brings years of SaaS development experience and battle-tested patterns to accelerate your success.
